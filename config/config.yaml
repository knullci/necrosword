  # Base directory for build workspaces
  # IMPORTANT: Both Knull and Necrosword must use the SAME absolute path!
  #
  # Configuration:
  #   Set the KNULL_WORKSPACE environment variable to an absolute path
  #   This same variable is used by both Knull CI/CD and Necrosword
  #   Examples:
  #     - Linux/macOS: export KNULL_WORKSPACE=/opt/knull/workspace
  #     - Windows: set KNULL_WORKSPACE=C:\knull\workspace
  #
  # Override with: NECROSWORD_EXECUTOR_WORKSPACE_BASE environment variable
  # Or use the shared: KNULL_WORKSPACE environment variable (recommended)
  #
  # If not set, defaults to "workspace" (relative to working directory)
  # WARNING: Relative paths only work if both services run from the same directory
  workspace_base: "workspace"
